Incident Report: 3.141592
Date: ██/██/██
Location: Skagerrak; coordinates ██/██/██
Entry: After ██████, our ██████ supercarrier "Govern". 
We had been monitoring working capacity around 2 months and now we loosed our communication with "Govern".
Our emergency fleet ████████  was moved to escalate issue but uncertainty they all gone.

2:42 PM: ████ reaching coordinate ██/██/██, still no visual confirmation.
2:50 PM: ████ I retrieving strange radio transmission on our █ ███ Ghz frequencies. 
The message contains repeating numbers like "0011110000-0000000111" its mismatch our standards.
2:55 PM: ████ I have visual on "Govern", radio transmission changed... they say... HQ we under attack...
2:56 PM: The "Govern" approx. 20 meters away from destroyer "Corax" and it continues attacking.
2:57 PM  We have heavy casualties almost our fleet destroyed... they everywhere...
2:59 PM: HQ, we heavily damaged... "Govern" intercepted control of our drone boats...

That was the last transmission from our emergency fleet ████. We cannot allow another incident such as this.
